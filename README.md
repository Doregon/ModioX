A federated desktop application for browsing a regularly updated collection of mods, homebrew and themes, populated by myself and a few friends so that almost all of them have been tested and verified to work. The core purpose is to provide users with an efficient method for browsing, downloading and installing game mods directly to their console, without the need for searching modding forums or using file managers - this does it all for you.

### Requirements
* An internet connection

### Getting Started
Go to Settings > Edit Consoles... and add your console name and the address. Otherwise, ignore that and enter your address manually in the textbox. Your address can be found under 'System Information' on the console.

### Connecting to Console
Simply click the **Connect** button. Note: this is only testing a connection to the console before you're able to install any files. 

### Browsing Mods
Finding mods is extremely simple too. Start by choosing and selecting a game from the long list titles/categories that are displayed on the left.

All of the mods that are available for will be loaded into the gridview, with some information such as the name, version and creator.

Further details that you'll need to know will be displayed on the right side when selecting an item, including the configuration and description. 

### Installing Mods
Before you use this step to install files, ensure that your console is either at the XMB menu or Rebug Toolbox open. Otherwise this could mean major errors occur when trying to install the files. 

You're able to install mods directly to your console by the using the installation paths that come with each of the mods, to do this simply click **Install** and it will complete everything for you, letting you know when you're ready to start the game.

### Uninstalling Mods
There is also an **Uninstall** option that will remove the modded files from inside your _/tmp/_ folder, unlike those that are installed into your game folders, in this case you're going to need to install the default files such as the _EBOOT.BIN_ and/or _patch_mp.ff_, etc. But you can find these files from the list which are under the names like 'Default EBOOT' and 'Default PATCH', so you can install those after uninstalling the previously installed mods.

### Downloading Mods
If you would like to do something else with the mods then you can use the **Download** button to download them locally to your computer.

### Reporting Mods
If you encounter issues with any of your for us all.

### Uploading Custom Files
So, rather than installing the predefined mods from the database you can choose to install your own files that you have locally. Under the section **Custom Installation* there are two text boxes, one points to the file on your hard drive, and the other is the installation file path for which you would like to install your file to. Click _..._  to  open your chosen file, then either enter your install path manually or from the dropdown next to the textbox. Then click **Install** to start the process. It will let you know once it's complete.

## Installation
