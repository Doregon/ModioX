<h1 align="center">ModioX</h1>

A federated desktop application designed to browse through a regularly updated library of game mods, homebrew and themes for the PlayStation 3. Populated by myself, few friends and awesome contributors, so that they're all verified and tested to work. One core purpose is to provide an efficient tool for browsing, downloading and installing mods directly to games on the console, without the need to dig up forums or use file managers - this aims to do it all for you.

### Getting Started
Firstly, under _Settings_ > _Edit Consoles_ you can add your console name and address to the list, for when you're ready to connect and upload files. Your address can be found under **System Information** on the console.

### Installing Mods
It's important to note that before install any files, ensure that your console is either at the xmb screen or with Rebug Toolbox open (and not connected to psn to be safe).

A compressed archive containing the modded files and a set of installation paths are included by default with each, so the **Install** process will be to the appropriate paths to work as instructed/intended.

### Uninstalling Mods
I would suggest you backup your original game files before installing mods, in case the mods fail to work for your system. So, the **Uninstall** option is still being worked on, to allow for this process to be automatic. But for now it will remove the specified installation files, except for those installed into your game folders, as it could cause issues for missing files. You can use the file explorer to re-install the original backed-up files to the game folder. 

### File Explorer
A simple ftp client is included, which allows for easily navigating both computer and console file systems. Go through your computer folders and choose your file, do the same to your console folders to where you'd like the file to be, then hit **Upload**, you can otherwise download or delete filees. Hopefully other features soon for this soon. 

### Reporting Issues
It's encouraged to submit reports of any issues that may occur with mods or files, whether that's ingame or installing. It will be looked into by someone and fixed as soon as we can.
