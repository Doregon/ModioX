<h1 align="left">ModioX</h1>

An open source desktop application designed to easily browse through a regularly updated library of game mods, homebrew and themes for the PlayStation 3. Populated by myself, few friends and awesome contributors, meaning  they're all verified and tested to work. It also utilizes and includes the ftp client, which allows for being able to install modded files directly to games using a set of installation paths, without the need for digging up old posts or using file managers - this aims to do everything for you.

## Usage

### Requirements
* NET Framework 4.6.2
* Modded PlayStation 3

### Getting Started
Firstly, under _Settings_ > _Edit Consoles_ to show the profiles window, enter console name and address and add to the list. Your address can be found under **System Information** on the console. You can hit *Connect* once you're ready to install files.

### Installing Mods
It's important to note that before installing any files, ensure that the console is either at the xmb screen or with Rebug Toolbox open (and to be safe, not connected to psn).

A compressed archive containing the modded files and a set of installation paths are included by default with each of the mods, so the installation process will be done at the appropriate paths in order for mods to work as instructed/intended.

### Uninstalling Mods
I would suggest backing-up the original game files before installing mods, in the case that mods fail to work. So, this option is still being worked on to be made automatic.

For now it will remove the specified installation files, except for files installed into your game folders. You can use the file explorer to re-install the original files to the game. 

### Reporting Mods
It's encouraged to submit reports of any issues that may occur with mods or files, but most likely be due to incompatible firmware or game region. 

## Installation
Download and run the latest version of the Windows installer, "ModioX.Installer.Windows.exe" from the [releases](https://github.com/ohhsoash/ModioX/releases/latest) page.
