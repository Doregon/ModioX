A federated desktop application for browsing a regularly updated collection of game mods, populated by myself and a few friends so that almost all of them have been tested and verified to work. The core purpose is to provide users with an efficient method for browsing, downloading and installing game mods directly to their console, without the need for searching modding forums or using file managers - this does it all for you.

## Usage

### Requirements
* An internet connection
* .NET Framework 4.6.2
* Console with DEX firmware

### Getting Started
You're going to want to add your console address to the application so that you're able to connect. Go to Settings > Edit Consoles... and fill in the information with your console name and the address. Otherwise you can ignore that and enter your address manually in the textbox. Your address can be found under 'System Information' on the console.

### Connecting Your Console
Select your console from the list or enter the address manually and then click the **Connect** button. Note: this is only testing a connection to the console before you're able to install any files to it.

### Browsing Mods
So to top everything off, finding mods for your console is extremely simple too. You will start by choosing and selecting a game from the list of supported titles that are displayed on the left side.

Then all of the mods that are available for your chosen game will be loaded into the gridview, with some information such as the name, version and creator.

When selecting any mods from the list, further details that you'll need to know will be displayed on the right side, including the configuration and description for the mod item. 

Now once you've found a nice mod that you want to use, there are a few things that you can do with them.

### Installing Mods
Before you use this step to install files, ensure that your console is either at the XMB menu or Rebug Toolbox open. Otherwise this could mean major errors occur when trying to install the files. 

You're able to install mods directly to your console by the using the installation paths that come with each of the mods, to do this simply click **Install** and it will complete everything for you, letting you know when you're ready to start the game.

### Uninstalling Mods
There is also an **Uninstall** option that will remove the modded files from inside your _/tmp/_ folder, unlike those that are installed into your game folders, in this case you're going to need to install the default files such as the _EBOOT.BIN_ and/or _patch_mp.ff_, etc. But you can find these files from the list which are under the names like 'Default EBOOT' and 'Default PATCH', so you can install those after uninstalling the previously installed mods.

### Downloading Mods
If you would like to do something else with the mods then you can use the **Download** button to download them locally to your computer.

### Reporting Mods
If you encounter issues with any of your for us all.

### Uploading Custom Files
So, rather than installing the predefined mods from the database you can choose to install your own files that you have locally. Under the section **Custom Installation* there are two text boxes, one points to the file on your hard drive, and the other is the installation file path for which you would like to install your file to. Click _..._  to  open your chosen file, then either enter your install path manually or from the dropdown next to the textbox. Then click **Install** to start the process. It will let you know once it's complete.

## Installation
Download and run the latest version of the Windows installer, "ModioX.Installer.Windows.exe" from the [releases](https://github.com/wh1ter0se-x/ModioX/releases/latest) page.
