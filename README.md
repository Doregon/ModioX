<h1 align="center">ModioX</h1>

A federated desktop application for browsing a regularly updated library of mods, homebrew and themes for the PlayStation 3. Database is populated by myself, few friends and now awesome contributors, so that they're all verified and tested to work. One core purpose is to provide an efficient method for browsing, downloading and installing game mods directly to their console, without the need for searching modding forums or using file managers - this does it all for you, with ease.

### Getting Started
First, go to _Settings_ > _Edit Consoles_ so you can add and save your console. Your address can be found under **System Information** from playstation console.

### Installing Mods
It's important to note that before install any files, ensure that your console is either at the xmb screen or with Rebug Toolbox open (and not connected to psn to be safe).

A compressed archive containing the modded files and a set of installation paths are included by default with each, so the **Install** process will be to the appropriate paths to work as instructed/intended.

### Uninstalling Mods
The **Uninstall** option is still being worked on to allow for original files to be backed up. But for now it will remove the specified installation files. Ones that are installed into your game folders are not deleted as it could cause issues with playing the game, these can include the _EBOOT.BIN_, _patch_mp.ff_, etc. You may be able to find the original/default files from the database, install those after uninstalling the game mods. .

### File Explorer
This includes a simple ftp client that allows easily navigating both computer and console file systems. Go through your computer folders and choose the desired file, do the same to your console folders to where you'd like to upload the file then hit **Upload**, otherwise you can download or delete files from your console too. Maybe more coming soon. 

### Reporting Issues
It's encouraged to submit reports of any issues that may occur with mods or files, whether that's with ingame or installing. It will be looked into by someone and fixed as soon as possible
